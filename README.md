![Orion UI](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/616359964/fad1ee21-1781-452f-843d-43af9eda0802)

Orion aims at being as simple as possible, but still provides rich features out-of-the-box.\
It's written in TypeScript, fully typed, because we care about DX.\
Based on Vue 3 and Vite, it's customizable and well documented.
